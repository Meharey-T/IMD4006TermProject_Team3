# IMD4006TermProject_Team3


Twig is a stealth collect-athon game in which players take control of the titular Kobold! This game was created by Team 3 in IMD4006A - Advanced Game Design and Development.

The player’s goal is to sneak around, avoiding detection from patrolling guards, while collecting valuables to appease Twig’s dragon. The dragon demands a certain amount of wealth for their hoard and Twig’s ultimate goal is to fulfill that demand. (Even if that wealth comes in the form of spoons and forks).

Twig has a variety of tactics to avoid capture, including hiding within barrels and boxes, rolling underneath low to the ground furniture, and sneaking around to minimize his stature and his sound footprint.

Plenty of long nights and effort were spent making this game, so we hope you enjoy our term project
